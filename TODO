BITFIELDS
    Uhm... Ok, but who uses bitfields, anyway?

CONSTANTS
    Well, something like CONST proxy type, values of which are never allocated
    more than once.

USER-DEFINED READERS/WRITERS/CLEANERS/DEALLOCATORS FOR STRUCTS
    More flexibility, you know.

BY-VALUE PASSAGE OF AGGREGATE TYPE FUNCTION PARAMETERS
    Well, this is obvious that most CL implementations do not allow
    aggregate types(structs etc.) to be passed by value. However, we can
    simulate this by converting values of fixed size into raw bytes
    and then passing that bytes as parameters. Not sure what to do with
    alignment stuff in this case.

EXAMPLES
    Some examples of library features.

TESTS
    A couple of tests would be nice.

DOCUMENTATION
    No comments.
