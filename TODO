RECURSIVE TYPES
    Particulary, reference types of structure slots. For now, it is not
    allowed for a slot type, even reference type, to be of
    structure type being defined, because EXPAND-* core generics, and
    probably even their run-time analogues, will hang while operating on them.

BY-VALUE PASSAGE OF AGGREGATE TYPE FUNCTION PARAMETERS
    Well, this is obvious that most CL implementations do not allow
    aggregate types(structs etc.) to be passed by value. However, we can
    simulate this by converting values of fixed size into raw bytes
    and then passing that bytes as parameters. Not sure what to do with
    alignment stuff in this case.

EXAMPLES
    Some examples of library features.

TESTS
    A couple of tests would be nice.
