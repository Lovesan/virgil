UNIONS OF IMMEDIATE/PRIMITIVE TYPES
    At the moment all unions are aggregate types. It means that even when
    all types in union are non-aggregate types, we cannot pass them
    by value in function calls.

BY-VALUE PASSAGE OF AGGREGATE TYPE FUNCTION PARAMETERS
    Well, this is obvious that most CL implementations do not allow
    aggregate types(structs etc.) to be passed by value. However, we can
    simulate this by converting values of fixed size into raw bytes
    and then passing that bytes as parameters. Not sure what to do with
    alignment stuff(see above) in this case.

EXAMPLES
    Some examples of library features.

TESTS
    A couple of tests would be nice.
